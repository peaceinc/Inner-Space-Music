# Inner Space Music

This project utilizes biofrequencies and elements of consciousness present in the atmosphere to generate synthentheic music. Simply run your choice of Drone or Tropical House genre. The enviornmental data collected will be saved to a file.

Note: you must pass in a "remarks" argument in the command line interface. This is an easy way to keep track of your data. Examples:

python Tropical.py FamilyGathering

python Drone.py YogaRetreat

You can download the required soundfonts, 'FluidR3_GM.sf2' (Drone) and 'Timbres Of Heaven (XGM) 3.94.sf2' (Tropical House) from:

# Minting NFTs

We are currently developing a process by which a user can mint the music data influencced by their consciousness with our Municipal Art Registry website (https://municipalartregistry.org/) which is currently under consideration by the city of Alameda, CA and has been authorized by a grant from the NEAR foundation.
